## Instruction
The application initially displays 5 random figures. In the menu, we can see the statistics of the drawn figures (the number of figures of a given shape and the surface area). 
In the option you can set the number of generated figures, the minimum and maximum property. There is also an option to regenerate figures in the menu. The last option in the menu
is information about the author of the application and about the application. You can also delete a single figure.
